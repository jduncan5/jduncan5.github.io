I"0<p>Hello, glad you found me! I am Joanna Duncan, and I am a problem solver based in Toronto. I decided to take my problem-solving skills to the field of UX/UI design in December 2019 and have taken a special interest in UX writing, UX research and UI design.  My passion for helping people and love for storytelling are the major driving forces in my journey as a designer, and I desire to design products that are enjoyed by all.</p>

<p>I love creating things that are practical, meaningful, but also beautiful from poetry to prose and now design. As a writer who has always been able to give words life, colour and motion, I now have the opportunity to make actual colours and imagery tell a pretty good story.</p>

<p>My educational background in interdisciplinary social science with a focus on human interaction and communication gives me an edge as a designer. It is one thing to be a good designer; it’s a whole other thing to have the ability to communicate good design; after all, designers are advocates.</p>

<p>In my downtime, I love to read, cook, play tennis and travel. My favourite place in the world is my mom’s house in Lagos, Nigeria; Disney world is a close second.</p>
