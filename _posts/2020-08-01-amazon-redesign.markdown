**The Task:** Focusing on specific user flows related to product browsing on Amazon.com and determining what the shared user pain points are when trying to complete specific tasks. There will be a greater emphasis on UX as opposed to UI, since Amazon already has an established brand/style.

**My Role:** UX Research & visual design
- Duration: 3 weeks
- Tools used: Adobe XD
- Team members: Mikella & Zine

First we conducted some research to ascertain the right direction for this project. 
Preliminary interviews uncovered common problems users had with:
- Finding new products/ browsing casually.
- Processing too much information.
- Dull design and confusing layout.

**The problem:**
- Amazon’s current layout makes casual browsing difficult and forces users to process too much product information.
- Many online shoppers visit the amazon.com website to buy various products from their vast catalogue. They don’t visit the website to browse for products but more for searching for specific products.
- Users are losing this browsing experience on the Amazon site. 
- We thought about how we could revamp the website to include this experience so that online shoppers enjoy browsing their large variety of products.

- Our goal was to improve product discoverability (casual browsing experience) & reduce page/information clutter for a more pleasant user experience
- We understood that Amazon.com is a big website with too many products and categories, and it will be challenging to redesign the whole website to improve the browsing experience.

> Our approach was simple: create a feature that makes Amazon’s content browsable, declutter Amazon’s product page to appeal to the average consumer.

In addition to reimagining the interface for amazon.com, we came up with a feature that will also serve the users who want to see what amazon has to offer. Amazon Explorer is a new feature for online shoppers who like to browse through the products catalogue.

This section is a small portion of the entire website; we see it as a new opportunity for Amazon to improve the browsing experience and let users enjoy it and discover more products. Its purpose is to alleviate some pain points we discovered during the research phase. This feature will help users discover products more easily as it categorizes amazon's offerings and can be personalized by the user, so that they see and are able to browse products relevant to them, instead of dealing with the overwhelming nature of the website.
